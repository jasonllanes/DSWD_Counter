# DSWD Relief Counter Dashboard Cursor Rule

## Project Overview

### Core Project Purpose
- Real-time monitoring system for DSWD relief goods production across 8 conveyor lines
- Acts as a bridge between physical sensors/Arduino and a modern web dashboard
- Supports warehouse staff in tracking and managing production output efficiently

### Technical Architecture

#### 1. Hardware Layer (handled by another team)
- 8 conveyor lines, each equipped with physical sensors
- Arduino Mega acts as the central data collector
- WebSocket is used for transmitting real-time data to the dashboard

#### 2. Dashboard Layer (your focus)
- Frontend React + TypeScript web application
- Real-time data visualization and monitoring
- Metrics tracked per conveyor line:
  - Daily Target (default: 1000, configurable)
  - Hourly Target (default: 166, configurable)
  - Production/Hr (calculated live based on sensor data)
  - Actual Production (total count per line)

#### 3. Data Management
- Local storage for offline resilience
- Firebase Firestore for manual cloud backups
- Excel export for reports
- Daily reset functionality (auto at midnight or via manual trigger)

#### 4. Additional Features
- Historical production data tracking and visualization
- Achievement alerts or production milestones
- Basic authentication (Google sign-in + email/password login)
